<p>This document aims at running a high-throughput over-representation
analysis (ORA) to discover bugphyzz signatures enriched in BugSigDB sets
and meta-signatures.</p>
<p>A few backgrounds will be used for the enrichment analysis: 1.
<em>TMS_BSDB</em>. Union of all of the taxa in the
TypicalMicrobiomeSignatures (TMS) dataset and BugSigDB. 2.
<em>TMS_BSDB_BS</em>. Union of all taxa in the TMS dataset and BugSigDB
by body site. 3. <em>BSDB</em>. Union of all taxa in BugSigDB. 4.
<em>BSDB_BS</em>. Union of all taxa in BugSigDB by body site. 5.
<em>TMS_1BSDB_BS</em>. Union of all of the taxa in the TMS dataset by
body site plus a target BugSigDB signature. 6.
<em>TMS_BSDB_intersect</em>. Intersection of all of the taxa in the TMS
dataset and BugSigDB. 7. <em>TMS_BSDB_BS_intersect</em>. Intersection of
all of the taxa in the TMS dataset and BugSigDB by body site.</p>
<p>ORA will be performed using a one-sided Fisherâ€™s exact test and the
odds ratio and CI will be calculated as well.</p>
